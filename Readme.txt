The Jupyter Notebook "VerifyOneSample.ipynb" contains the project to verify one sample.  Each sample consists of 1252 pieces of data, each separated by a 'comma'.  The 1252 pieces of data are as follows:

1 entry for "GameID"
1 entry for "NumberOfSteps"
625 entries for "Start-Square"
625 entries for "End-Square"

Included in this project are two test samples, namely GOL-Train-ID00000.txt and GOL-Train-ID000001.txt.  

When you launch the VerifyOneSample.ipynb notebook, you will be prompted to enter the filename containing one sample - you can enter one of the two above samples (or you can create your own)
